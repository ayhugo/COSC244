ncrypting data using a bit-level cipher involves taking an encryption key, letâ€™s say a simple
string, and performing an XOR (exclusive OR) operation between each byte in the key and the
corresponding byte in the information to be encrypted. If the encryption key is shorter than
the data, then just loop back to the start of the encryption key and continue the process until
all data has been encrypted. To decrypt the encrypted data, simply repeat the encryption
process, since performing two XORs with the same key will return the original valu
